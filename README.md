# Application_Of_ObjectDetection_For_TrafficManagement
This project can be used in real life for traffic management which will reduce waiting time of vehicles in high traffic areas.Using YOLO and OpenCV we will detect number of vehicles(incoming &amp;&amp; outgoing) in all directions according to that we wrote an algorithm that will adjust waiting time according to the vehicle count.
